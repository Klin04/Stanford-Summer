If only you could see the tears
in the world you left behind
If only you could hear my heart
just one more time
Even when I close my eyes
There's an image of your face
And once again I come to realise
You're a loss I can't replace
bugs
It's a keeping for the lonely
Since the day that you were gone
Why did you leave me
bugs
In my heart you were the only
And your memory lives on
Why did you leave me
bugs
Walking down the streets of Nothingville
Where our love was young and free
Can't believe just what an empty place
It has come to be
I would give my life away
If it could only be the same
Cause I can't still the voice inside of me
That is calling out your name
bugs
It's a keeping for the lonely
Since the day that you were gone
Why did you leave me
bugs

In my heart you were the only
And your memory lives on
Why did you leave me
Soledad
Time will never change the things you told me
After all we're meant to be
love will bring us back to you and me
If only you could see
Soledad
It's a keeping for the lonely
Since the day that you were gone
Why did you leave me
Soledad
In my heart you were the only
And your memory lives on
Why did you leave me
Soledad
It's a keeping for the lonely
Since the day that you were gone
Why did you leave me
Soledad
In my heart you were the only
And your memory lives on
Why did you leave me
Soledad
